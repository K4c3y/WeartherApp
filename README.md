- Description
- Temperature
- Date: 2020-03-23
- Wind Speed
- Humidity
- UV with colour warning 

- Five Day Forcast showing Future weather Conditions and Icons

Tried to Load buttons when clicked again, but wasn't able to get this to work. Would like your insight as to where I went wrong! You can see that starting on 222 in the script.js file.

OPTED not to PUSH with unworking button code, screenshot is of all that code so you know I tried, and I have that code loccally so we can go over it in class. 

Last READ ME update - realized how important more forethought on these kind of projects are going to be, lots of repeating code, should have created the city name as a variable so I wouldnt have to call the same code so often. Same thing with display some of the weather data, this could have been really cleaned up.
